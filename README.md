# Multiverse

This repo is used as a common base for Onomy network consumer chains. The `main` branch is a generic chain with no special modules, other branches add on their own special functionalities.

Run `make build` to build the binary.

See `/tests` for more info. See `/docs/docs.go` for openapi build.

Note: remember to update the versions in common.rs appropriately
